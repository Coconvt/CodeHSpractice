            <h2>Music education falls into the teaching industry.</h2>
            <p>
                Music educators, like most educators, do not make much money.
                It's sad but it's true. Music educators often direct the choirs in their schools.
                However, they are not limited to this.
                They can also teach private lessons or direct choirs outside of schools.
